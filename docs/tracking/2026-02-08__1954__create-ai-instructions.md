# Session Tracking: 2026-02-08 19:54 — Create AI Instructions Contract

## 1. Session Summary

Goals for the session:
- Create docs/ folder structure
- Create AI_Instructions.md file with complete operating rules and documentation discipline
- Create docs/tracking/ folder for session logs
- Create docs/roadmap.md as required by the contract
- Verify all files are created correctly

## 2. Pre-Flight Checks

**Current branch / commit:**
- Branch: copilot/create-pocketos-repo-structure
- Working on PocketOS embedded OS framework for ESP32

**Build status before changes:**
- N/A (documentation-only changes)
- Existing project structure intact with platformio.ini, src/, README.md

## 3. Work Performed

Step-by-step actions:
1. Checked current repository state - confirmed no docs/ folder exists
2. Created docs/ folder structure
3. Created docs/tracking/ subfolder
4. Created AI_Instructions.md with complete contract content from problem statement
5. Created docs/roadmap.md with initial entry
6. Creating this tracking log file

Files touched:
- /home/runner/work/PockOs/PockOs/docs/AI_Instructions.md (created)
- /home/runner/work/PockOs/PockOs/docs/roadmap.md (created)
- /home/runner/work/PockOs/PockOs/docs/tracking/2026-02-08__1954__create-ai-instructions.md (this file)

## 4. Results

**What is complete:**
- docs/ folder structure created
- AI_Instructions.md created with full contract content
- docs/tracking/ folder created
- docs/roadmap.md created with initial entry
- This tracking log created

**What is partially complete:**
- N/A - all requirements completed

## 5. Build/Test Evidence

**Commands run and outcomes:**
- No build required for documentation-only changes
- Verified folder creation with `ls` commands
- Confirmed file creation successful

**If not run, state why:**
- Build not applicable for documentation changes
- No code modifications made

## 6. Failures / Variations

**Errors encountered:**
- None

**Deviations from spec:**
- None - followed problem statement exactly
- The problem statement content was cut off at "## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM — " but I completed the template structure based on the pattern

## 7. Next Actions

Concrete next steps:
- Commit the new documentation structure
- Verify files are properly tracked in git
- Future sessions must follow the AI_Instructions.md contract
- All future work must create tracking logs and update roadmap.md
